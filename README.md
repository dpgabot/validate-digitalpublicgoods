# Validate Digital Public Goods App

The [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) is now crowdsourcing reviews of digital public goods! Weâ€™re asking you to participate by reviewing open source projects against the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard) with the ultimate goal of determining if a project qualifies as a Digital Public Good.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

Open source represents an unprecedented opportunity to fundamentally alter power balances in international development. But, we canâ€™t harness that power without the cooperation of many - reviewers, maintainers, creators, policy makers, and so many others (that means you! ðŸ‘Š).

This community sourcing exercise will give you the opportunity to delve into some of the largest up and coming open source projects. Youâ€™ll get a chance to understand their licenses and documentation, and how theyâ€™re designing for best practices, standards, privacy and more.

By participating, youâ€™ll get a better understanding of open projects that are making a difference in the world, particularly those that are advancing practical solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Youâ€™ll also join a growing number of innovators working on technology for development (T4D).

## ðŸŽ® App

The app is live at https://validate.digitalpublicgoods.net for anyone to contribute!

## ðŸ’» Development Environment

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/lacabra/validate-digitalpublicgoods.git
cd validate-digitalpublicgoods
npm i
```

### 2. Configure your local environment

1. Copy the .env.local.example file in this directory to .env.local (which will be ignored by Git):

   ```
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Clone [unicef/publicgoods-candidates](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates) to your personal account and set the following variables in `.env.local`:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OWNER="YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO=publicgoods-candidates
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_MAIN=master
   ```

3. Create your [GitHub OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app), with the following values:

   - Homepage URL: http://localhost:3000
   - Authorization Callback URL: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github

   and set the following variables in `.env.local`:

   ```
   GITHUB_ID=
   GITHUB_SECRET=
   ```

### 3. Start the application

To run your site locally, use:

```
npm run dev
```

To run it it production mode, use:

```
npm build
npm start
```

### 4. Configuring for production

You must set the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable with the URL of your site, before deploying to production.

e.g. `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://example.com`

To do this in on Vercel, you can use the [Vercel project dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) or the `now env` command:

    now env add NEXTAUTH_URL production

Be sure to also set environment variables for the Client ID and Client Secret values for all your authentication providers.
